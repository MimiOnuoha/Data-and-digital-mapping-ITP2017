# Everything is Spatial: Data and Digital Mapping

**Instructor**: Mimi Onuoha  
**Time**: Mondays 3:20 - 5:50
</br>**Contact**: <cgo221@nyu.edu>
</br>**Office Hours**: [Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUl0bkJBeEw5QmpTfGRlZmF1bHR8MTVmMGJiY2ZkYjkyNWQ0NGQ1Y2YzODliMDQ0MmRlODU)

## Course Description


Digital technologies have created new opportunities and resources for mapping, cartography, and geolocation-based visual investigation. It has also brought the need to consider issues concerning power, representation, and space. In this seven-week course, students will be introduced to GIS (geographical information system) basics and learn the practical realities of working with spatial data using digital mapping tools and technologies like mapshaper, Leaflet.js, TileMill, MapBox, and d3.js. Special attention will be paid to working with different types of data (specifically geodata) formats. 

Time will also be devoted to investigating the conceptual questions that inform geographic data collection/representation and strategies for counter-mapping. Topics of discussion will include: what do maps represent as visual information artifacts? What happens when we consider claims to space as topics for art-based investigations? How is the expression of geodata a result of political processes? What does it mean for virtual creations to refer to physical realities, and in what ways do the two shape one another? 

Students will work individually on weekly assignments, but will have the opportunity to collaborate on a final project that addresses the techniques and topics studied in the course. To get the most out of this course, students should already have an understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript basics. 

This two-credit course will meet the first seven weeks of the semester. 


#### Format
Each week will begin with a selection of students presenting assignment from previous week. If there was a reading assigned, the class will start with a brief discussion of it (no laptops open during discussion).  The bulk of the class will be spent introducing and experimenting with more technical mapping methods and tools.

#### Learning Objectives 
- Exposure to broad range of techniques in digital mapping (students should eventually focus on one or two)
- Become conversational in the topics that surround the theory and understanding of cartography and mapping space
- Create maps (or map-based objects) that work as art objects and challenge common conventions or understandings of the capabilities of maps.

#### Grading
Course marks will be determined by evaluating class participation, weekly assignments, and the final project.

## Syllabus 
NOTE I: This syllabus is subject to change, and will be updated weekly. Star and check often!


#### Week One - January 23
*About the course, logistics, and each other.* 

*What is a map? What's the history of mapping? How are maps used in ways that advance agendas? What are the tools involved in digital/web mapping, and what makes it different from its predecessors?* 

[Presentation](http://mimionuoha.github.io/spring2017-digitalmapping/weekone/): a quick history of mapping; analog vs digital vs web; how web mapping works; what maps do

- Introductions
- Discussion / Viewing: What can mapping do?
- Demonstration: A simple web map (Leaflet.js)

**ASSIGNMENTS**:

- Read the introduction to [this](https://www.justinobeirne.com/cartography-comparison) comparison of Google Maps and Apple Maps. 
- Create a map:
	- Change the [location](http://www.latlong.net/)
	- Use Leaflet.js, load tiles from [Stamen](http://maps.stamen.com/#toner-lite/12/37.7707/-122.3781), [CartoDB](https://cartodb.com/basemaps/) or any other basemap provider 
	- Push map online to your blog or github.io page and send me the link before Monday
- Go through [this](http://maptime.io/anatomy-of-a-web-map/#0) (but skim it! don't worry too much, we'll talk more in class)
- Download [Moves App](https://moves-app.com/) and record your activity this week. You don't have to sign in with Facebook, and you don't have to create an account.
	


#### Week Two - January 30

*Where does geographic data come from? What forms does it take, how has it been used in the past? How should we think about it now? Plus everything you need to know about tiles, and the basic anatomy of a web map.*

- Discussion of Reading + Assignments
- Demonstration: Adding data to our maps (tools: geojsonlint, Mapshaper, geojson.io). 

**ASSIGNMENTS**: [to come]  

- Read [Borges](Borges_exactitudeinscience.pdf) and Baudrillard (in that order) 
- Read this article on [When Google Goes Blind](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/investigating-censored-spots-on-google-earth) 
- Add at least one geojson layer to your map(s):
	- Use data that you have gathered from somewhere else. Make sure you incorporate 
- Keep your Moves data running! 

	
#### Week Three - February 6
*An overview of map projections, dealing more with data and geodata*

- Discussion + go over last week's reading
- Last week's assignment
- Demonstration: More on finding, converting, and working with data. 

**ASSIGNMENTS**: [to come] 

#### Week Four - February 13
*Visual Cues, Design Considerations. How can we use visual cues to tell stories? What are the traditional design rules of maps, and how can and should we interact with them?* 

- Discussion + last week's assignment
- Demonstration: Visual tools for thinking about maps. Tilemill, more on Mapbox, [ColorBrewer](http://colorbrewer2.org/)
(and vice versa). 

**ASSIGNMENTS**: [to come]


#### Week Five - February 27
*Discussing final projects: expectations, presentation. Aerial and Satellite Imagery.*

- Discussion + last week's assignment
- Viewing: Examples of maps that play with the limits of geography (aka, [inspiration](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ls269cdpsnw3dan/inspiration.pdf?dl=0) for final projects)
- Final project brief and requirements.
- Demonstration: working and playing with Satellite images 

**ASSIGNMENTS**: [to come]
