# Final Project Brief

**THE BRIEF:**</br>
Create a map (or something map-based) that functions as an art object, represents data in a surprising/creative way, questions some aspect of digital mapping, challenges common conventions or understandings of physical space.

**WHAT THAT MEANS**</br>
Make something that interrogates geographic space and utilizes the concepts, topics, tools, or methodology that we have been working with. We've covered lots of things, Think about why you are mapping something; what your conceptual interests are.

I'm more interested in what you choose to do than in what you can do. What is something that you think is interesting that you want to play around with, or visualize, or investigate? If you have an idea but aren't sure of how to do it, email me or sign up for [office hours](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/selfsched?sstoken=UUl0bkJBeEw5QmpTfGRlZmF1bHR8MTVmMGJiY2ZkYjkyNWQ0NGQ1Y2YzODliMDQ0MmRlODU)! 

**YOU CAN:**</br>

- Work alone or in pairs
- Create something web-based, digital, or physical (as long as it incorporates something that we have been working with)
- Combine with a midterm/project from another class


**PRESENTATIONS:**</br>

- You will each have ten minutes to presents, including time for questions. You should plan to talk for about 7-8 minutes. 
- Make sure that you have a publicly-accessible documentation of the work you've done (in other words, take pics and write something up about your project! It'll be helpful to you in the future)
