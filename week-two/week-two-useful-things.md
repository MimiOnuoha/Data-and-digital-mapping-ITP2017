Access the Developer console in Chrome: 
`View` -> `Developer` -> `Developer Tools` or `Javascript Console `

</br>Use `console.log` to print out something for checking in the browser console. To clear your browser console: `console.clear()`


</br>Jquery: `JSON`(as in `$.getJSON()`)) Leaflet: `Json` (as in `L.geoJson`)

</br>[Mapshaper](mapshaper.org) is good for previewing or changing data into geoJSON (also changes into other formats). [Ogre](https://ogre.adc4gis.com/) is also a good tool for conversion. 

</br>[GeoJSONLint](http://geojsonlint.com/): Validate and understand GeoJSON format. 
</br>
Make sure that your Json or geoJson looks right using [this site](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/#). 

</br>GeoJSON files can end in`.json` or `.geojson`. 

</br>Leaflet organizes coordinates as `[lon,lat]`; but in GeoJSON, coordinates are reversed so that it's `[lat,lon]`. 

</br>Longitude and latitude for viewing the USA: [`38.5858857, -94.287649`]

# Useful Things: Week One

List all the files in a directory:
		
		ls
		
	
Navigate to a directory in the current one:

		cd foldername
		

Navigate to up to the previous directory:

		cd ../previousfoldername
		

Navigate to any directory:

		cd ~/foldername
		

Start up a Python local server:   
  

		python -m SimpleHTTPServer 5000 

To navigate to it in the browser, go to the url: `localhost:5000`		
To close this server, hit the keys `CTRL + C`.  	

</br></br>Other tips: 

- If you push the `up` arrow, terminal will pull up your previous command
- Similarly, typing `!!` will run the previous command
- Type `history` to see the commands that you've entered in the past. 
- Type `pwd` to see the path name of directory that you're currently in. 
- If you hit the `tab` key while you're entering a pathname, it'll autocomplete it for you.
